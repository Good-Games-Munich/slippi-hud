# Slippi-HUD
### A Slippi powered stream overlay

Welcome to Slippi-HUD, a nodecg package that can be used to power all kinds of slippi powered melee streams. You can create your own custom HUD, or an auto updating stream overlay.

To get started you should probably head over and [install nodecg](https://node.dev)

Learning command-line might be worth your while.

Next you'll want to install this package. I reccomend using the nodecg-cli method detailed at the nodecg tutorial. It makes life easy.

## Accessing the dashboard
just start nodecg in terminal(command line) 

then open up your browser and head to [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) The default webpage.

## Finally how are you connecting to melee?

### In-Person
I reccomend the console mirroring option the slippi desktop program provides. (Version 1.6.10 works best for me)

Start the console mirror process

Select Console Relay in the dashboard and enter the port the slippi desktop app gives you.

Press connect

### Slippi Online
Start up dolphin

Select dolphin in the drop-down 

press connect
